#stockSnapshot
This page is meant to be used to help users get a snapshot of current information about a single stock equity.  It is not meant to be used to get information on ETFs, Mutual Funds, or Index Funds.  This project retrieves data from an external API, Yahoo Finance API, and displays financial data based on a stock ticker symbol.  A regular expression is utilized to validate the format of a stock ticker symbol.  If an invalid input is entered, an error message will display.  When the market is open, the project will calculate and display the time remaining until the market is closed. If the time is outside of market hours, or the weekend, then the page will display that the market is closed.  The project also has a watch list area where users can add stock ticker symbols (or text that meet the syntax of a symbol) into a list.  They can also remove items from this list.
